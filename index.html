              <p>
                David has spent his entire career serving the community.
              </p>

              <p>
                After graduating from Shorecrest High School, David developed a passion for social justice and leadership by serving as a community facilitator in Western Washington University’s campus ministry. David then attended Seattle University School of Law where he worked with youth at the King County Juvenile Detention Center and educated them on how to advocate for their rights.
              </p>

              <p>
                As a young attorney, David fought for civil rights representing employees in discrimination and civil rights claims.
              </p>

              <p>
                David is a former member of the Parks Funding Advisory Committee and several non-profit boards, including seven years with Vision House in Shoreline, an agency that successfully moved hundreds of single parents and their children from homelessness to permanent housing.
              </p>
              <p>
                David and his wife Chelsey are the proud parents of three children. They live in the Echo Lake neighborhood with their dog. David and Chelsey are active volunteers with the Echo Lake Neighborhood Association, Shoreline Little League, Cascade K-8 PTSA, St. Catherine of Siena Church, and the Midvale Community Garden.

                Affordable Housing for all Ages and Incomes
              </h3>
              <p class="mb-0">
                Shoreline needs more affordable and diverse housing options. Our community needs housing for seniors looking to age in place and for families looking for a place to call home. David will increase access to both rental and permanent housing for all ages and incomes. David supports strategic development to bring small businesses and living wage jobs to Shoreline by modernizing building codes and creating incentives that support sustainable growth.

              <p class="mb-0">
                As a father of three, David knows the importance of safe, walkable streets. Shoreline needs properly maintained sidewalks; improved lighting on streets and walking paths; more accessible community gathering spaces; and safe trails connecting people to parks, nature, and businesses. As a member of the City Council, David will collaborate with residents to prioritize specific locations that need immediate improvement and will develop a long-term plan to create a welcoming, inclusive city center.

                A New Approach to Homelessness
              </h3>
              <p class="mb-0">
                As the former Board President of Vision House—a non-profit housing agency in Shoreline that helps single parents and their children transition out of homelessness into permanent housing—David has hands-on experience and expertise addressing homelessness. In addition to supporting local direct-service organizations and increasing affordable housing options, David will work across boundaries to implement a regional strategy that tackles barriers to permanent housing. David supports on-demand addiction and mental health services that will help our neighbors get off the streets and into stable housing.

              </h3>
              <p class="mb-0">
                David will support increased diversity and resiliency of small businesses in Shoreline by reducing the barriers to starting and operating a business in the city. Shoreline needs to encourage business development and partnerships by increasing pedestrian traffic, available parking and neighborhood gathering spaces, within our commercial centers.
